I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign advised by [Prof. Sasa Misailovic](http://misailo.web.engr.illinois.edu/) and [Prof. Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io/). 

I have strong interest in the intersection of machine learning (ML) and programming language/formal methods research. I care deeply about the future of ML and the role of formal methods in building reliable ML systems. Most recently, I worked on [structured LLM generation](https://structuredllm.com/), developing a new parsing techniques that can control LLMs to enforce the syntax and semantics of the generation. Before this, I worked on developing various formal method techniques that can be used to certify ML models. I also worked in the industry on open-source static analysis tools.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
